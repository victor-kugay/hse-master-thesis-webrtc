				We limit ourselves to collect the smallest amount of user data that we need to create a seamless experience when
				using Tlk. This data includes
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCIceCandidate" target="_blank">
					RTCICECandidates
				</a>
				&
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCSessionDescription" target="_blank">
					RTCSessionDescription
				</a>
				which is needed to establish the video call using WebRTC, your name & chat for a messaging experience inside the
				app. RTCICECandidates & RTCSessionDescription is not stored in any persistent database, it's removed from the
				server as soon as the user leaves the call by closing the browser window. Your chat messages, video & audio are
				all 100% peer-to-peer, meaning they never touch our server at all. We also collect your name which will be
				stored on your browser and used to identify the chat messages you send.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tlk is purely peer-to-peer, which means the user's video & audio is not sent to our server at all. We also use
				Cabin Analytics to track aggregated usage statistics in order to improve our service, which can be seen here in
				this
